## Measure of Centers

1. Mean = Summation of all values divided by their count
2. Mode = Most frequent elements
3. Median = middle value of dataset (differs from odd/even sized dataset)

---

## Measure of Spread

1. Variance = measure of how far each value in the data set is from the mean
2. Standard Deviation = number that tells how data is spread along the x-axis
  calculated by square rooting the variance
3. Range = Maximum - Minimum
4. IQR = Q3 (median of list 2) - Q1 (median of list 1)
  list 1 & list 2 are subsets of the given dataset, where list 1 is all dataset values less than median & list 2 is all dataset values large than median

## Future Work

1. Mode Value part is not useful, to be fixed.
2. On clicking any of the labels, a tooltip will pop up explaining it
3. New notifications system (like message toast)
4. Help button in Histogram form to explain how to draw and what data can be fetched from a histogram
5. Form where box plot of the dataset can be drawn
6. Help button like the histogram's form
