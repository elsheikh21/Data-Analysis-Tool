## Measure of Centers

1. Mean = Summation of all values divided by their count
2. Mode = Most frequent elements
3. Median = middle value of dataset (differs from odd/even sized dataset)

---

## Measure of Spread

1. Variance = measure of how far each value in the data set is from the mean
2. Standard Deviation = number that tells how data is spread along the x-axis
  calculated by square rooting the variance
3. Range = Maximum - Minimum
4. IQR = Q3 (median of list 2) - Q1 (median of list 1)
  list 1 & list 2 are subsets of the given dataset, where list 1 is all dataset values less than median & list 2 is all dataset values large than median

## Future Work

1. Form where box plot of the dataset can be drawn
2. Help button to explain boxplot
